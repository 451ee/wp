The aim of Project 451 is to monitor the statistics obtained from the government and authorised organisations about the blocking or removal of content.

The aim of this github repo is to provide a out-of-the-box solution for anyone who wants to start a similar project in their own country. 

Since the first hassle for us was creating a website with this information, we open-sourced the website and we will also provide you with a step-by-step information on how to start in your own country.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install as as Wordpress theme:
1. Place the 451.ee folder into "themes" folder. 
2. Activate the "451.ee" theme in /wp-admin/themes.php

ALERT - the site currently errors when WPML (explained next) is not installed.

We also suggest you use the WPML multi-language plugin. 
It's the solution we use for multi language sites and it's free for non-profits.

1) Download WPML plugin - http://wpml.org/purchase/non-profits/
2) Move the WPML plugin to /wp-conten/plugins
3) Activate the WPML plugin at /wp-admin/plugins.php

It worked this morning.
